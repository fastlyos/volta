Building volta
===============

Volta should build with minimal effort and without external dependencies, except for
GNU make. (http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)


Compiling
---------

Just type 'make'.  Depending on your platform, GNU make may have been
installed as 'gmake' If you get any errors, try 'gmake' first.

It should build without warnings.


Installation
------------

Volta doesn't contain any installation targets.  You can put the binary
wherever makes sense on your system.  Note that it should be in a
directory that is writable to Squid, unless you plan to store the
database separately.  An example:

	mv volta /usr/local/bin
	mkdir -p /var/db/squid
	chown squid:squid /var/db/squid
	volta -f /var/db/squid/volta.db

I usually just drop it into the squid configuration directory and run it
from there.

For usage information, see the README.


Development
-----------

Volta source can be cloned via Mercurial.  The repo is found at:

	http://code.martini.nu/volta

You can use the 'debug' make target to compile a (very noisy) binary
that contains gdb symbols and perftool hooks.  Set the CPUPROFILE
environment variable to "cpu.prof" to generate a profile.

If you're hacking, you'll want these dependencies installed too.
